DESCRIPTION:
This project focuses on developing an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard using sample Zepto sales data to analyze business performance through sales trends, top-performing products, and regional performance. The objective of this task is to demonstrate the ability to transform raw sales data into meaningful visual insights that support data-driven decision-making. By leveraging Power BI’s visualization and analytical capabilities, the dashboard provides a comprehensive view of Zepto’s sales operations across different time periods, product categories, and geographic regions.
The dashboard is designed to present key sales metrics such as total revenue, number of orders, average order value, and sales growth trends. A time-series analysis is incorporated to track daily, weekly, and monthly sales performance, enabling stakeholders to identify patterns, seasonal fluctuations, and peak demand periods. This helps in understanding customer purchasing behavior and evaluating overall business performance over time.
